        <p>In a devastated Earth overrun by myriads of invincible extraterrestrial predators, the Abbotts struggle to survive in the desolate death trap of New York City. In this muffled dystopia, utter silence may offer a chance to stay alive, as even the slightest noise can attract the deadly invaders. However, despite twelve months of relentless terror, the resilient Abbotts remain unbroken, mastering the art of survival. But now, more than ever, they must live by one rule: don't make a sound or suffer the consequences.</p>
